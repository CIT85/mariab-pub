            <h2>Why I'm taking this course</h2>
            <p>
                I am taking this course because I grew interested in coding and web development. Luckily this course did not require the completion of CIT15 like every other one. I better have to use some concept of word or excel in the other classes or I will lose it. So far this course has been very fun and interesting, sometimes my computer won't respond the same way as the video and unfortunatly i get stuck trying to catch up to the same result. Otherwise definitly fun.

            <h2>Thoughts on using ChatGPT for Research</h2>
            <p>
                Chat reminds me of a different website I heard about in high school. We could upload a file and it would just rewrite it using different words inplace of the original, which would then would result in a paper that didn't make sense. I was experimenting with Chat and noticed that is does just spit out generic answers and sometimes in the mix there will be some sections that don't make sense. It is a good way to get ideas out and a lot at once. It's kind of like when you write down any thought to generate ideas. It also helps to have countless of different answers to the same question.
