                <h2>Calorie Quality</h2>
                <!-- Calorie article -->
                    <p>
                        The quality of calorie intake plays a crucial role in overall health, energy levels, and body composition. High-quality calories come from nutrient-dense foods that provide essential vitamins, minerals, and other beneficial nutrients. These nutrients are vital for supporting various bodily functions, including metabolism, immune function, and tissue repair. Consuming nutrient-dense foods ensures that your body receives the necessary nutrients to thrive and function optimally. Foods rich in protein, fiber, and healthy fats are more satiating than processed, low-nutrient foods. By prioritizing high-quality calories, you can feel fuller for longer periods and better manage hunger and cravings. This can help prevent overeating and support weight management goals by promoting a balanced and sustainable approach to eating. Quality calories provide the energy your body needs to fuel daily activities and support physical performance, including exercise and workouts. Carbohydrates, in particular, are the body's primary source of energy, and choosing complex carbohydrates from whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can provide sustained energy levels and enhance athletic performance.
