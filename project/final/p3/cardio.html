        <h2>Warm Up</h2>
        <!-- Warm Up Article -->
            <p>
                The warm-up is a crucial component of any cardio exercise routine, as it prepares the body for physical activity, reduces the risk of injury, and enhances performance. Aim for a warm-up duration of 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the intensity and duration of your planned cardio workout. A longer warm-up may be necessary for higher-intensity activities or when exercising in cold weather.
