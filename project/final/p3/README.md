#   Fitness
I've always had an interest in health and fitness, however I am not very educated on the subject. Just like anything, there is A LOT of information online. Some misleading, some outdated, and some very vague. Not to mention that you have to visit multiple different sites to have a general idea that includes all the information. I'd like to create a page as if it was a starter blueprint for myself.

#   Flexbox 
I used flexbox to center the title and nav menus to be in the center of the page of my main html page. I also experimented with combining what i included in 1 class css to see if it worked on all.
#   Query
I did notice how to get a resposive page with query. As soon as the page increased to the set pixle size the background color changed.
