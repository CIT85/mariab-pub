                                To promote muscle growth (hypertrophy), it's important to incorporate a well-rounded workout routine that includes resistance training, proper nutrition, adequate rest, and progressive overload.
                                Perform each exercise with proper form, focusing on controlled movements and full range of motion.
                                Choose weights that allow you to complete the desired number of reps with good form while still challenging yourself.
                                Rest for 60-90 seconds between sets to allow for adequate recovery.
                                Incorporate progressive overload by gradually increasing the weight, reps, or sets over time to continue challenging your muscles.

                    <p>
                        Muscle recovery is essential after weightlifting to repair damaged muscle tissue, replenish energy stores, and maximize gains.

                    <h3>Muscle Massaging</h3>
                    <!-- Massage Section -->
                        <p>
                            Use foam rollers, massage balls, or massage therapy to release muscle tightness, improve circulation, and reduce muscle soreness. Foam rolling before and after workouts can help alleviate muscle tension and improve recovery by breaking up adhesions and trigger points.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Sleep is Important</h3>
                    <!-- Sleep Section -->
                        <p>
                            Allow your muscles adequate time to rest and recover between workouts. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to support muscle repair, hormone regulation, and overall recovery. Avoid overtraining by scheduling rest days into your workout routine and listening to your body's signals of fatigue or soreness.
                        </p>
